                <p>A short time ago in a classroom not far away... <br> <br> <br> <br>
                    Three students were working on their Java examn, along the way they faced many obstacles, but did
                    their
                    best to overcome them, all the while the great emperor Darth Brodwall was breathing down their
                    necks,
                    waiting for them to deliever. <br>
                    The three students felt the perssure but fought on to deliever the best project they knew how to.
                    <br>
                    but in the end all they could to was write <br> A New Code.... </p>
